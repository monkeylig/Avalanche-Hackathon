  - Ahh Little One...
  - I suppose this weapon is the best you can handle for now.
  - I'm affraid things will only get harder for you from this point on.
  - This cave takes the minds of unexpecting explorers, and they will be hostile.
  - I will be waiting for you at the cave's exit.
  - Let's pray you can make it that far.
